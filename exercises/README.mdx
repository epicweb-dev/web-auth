👨‍💼 Hello, my name is Peter the Product Manager. I'm here to help you get
oriented and to give you your assignments for the day. We're going to have you
working on authentication for the Epic Notes app today.

So far any user can edit all the notes, even if they're not logged in! Obviously
we need to give users an opportunity to create accounts and then lock down their
data to their account. Throughout the workshop, you'll learn important
foundational skills of full stack development like:

1. Storing user preferences in cookies
2. Using session storage and the "flash" pattern
3. Using cookies to identify users
4. Managing and safely storing passwords
5. Securely validating passwords
6. Managing logout and session expiration ("remember me")
7. Locking down UI and backend routes
8. Support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
9. Support server-managed sessions
10. Sending emails to users
11. Building cryptographically secure verifications
12. Support "forgot password" and reset password flows
13. Supporting securely changing emails
14. Adding two-factor authentication (2FA)
15. Support verifying 2FA codes
16. Securely disabling 2FA
17. Supporting OAuth (social login)
18. Handling Connection Errors
19. Supporting Third Party Login
20. Connection Management
21. Redirecting third party logins with redirect Cookies

It's a big job and there's lots to do, so, let's get started!
