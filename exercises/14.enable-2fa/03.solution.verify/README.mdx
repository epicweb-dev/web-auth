# Verify Code

👨‍💼 Great job! Users can now enable 2FA on their account. Next we'll make that
actually mean something 😅

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to make a slight adjustment to
the <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/verify.tsx" /> route because right now
it tells the user to check their email in all cases, but in the 2FA case, we
want them to check their 2FA app. Feel free to do that change yourself if you
like, or you can <DiffLink>check the diff</DiffLink>.
