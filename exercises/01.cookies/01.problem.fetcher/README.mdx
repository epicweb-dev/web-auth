# Fetchers

👨‍💼 To get started with cookies in our application, we're going to start with
something a little lighter weight than authentication: Theme Preference.

Before we get to that though, we need to wire up our `ThemeSwitch` component to
make a network request.

🦉 Remix's `<Form />` component resembles the regular `<form />` component which
is to say that it's a mechanism for navigating with data. However, there are
lots of mutations we make that don't involve a navigation.

- Navigation: Creating a GitHub issue -> Navigate to the new issue
- Non-Navigation: Liking a Tweet -> Update the UI to show the like

In Remix, we have a `<Form />` component for navigation and `useNavigation` to
have information about the current navigation. We can do this because there can
only be one navigation at time. However, with non-navigation mutations, you can
have many of them at once. So we need a different mechanism for handling these
mutations.

That mechanism is [`useFetcher`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-fetcher).
`useFetcher` gives us the ability to perform any kind of fetch request. It
definitely can result in a `redirect`, but often does not. It still uses
`loader`s for GETs and `action`s for POSTs, but all the information about the
request is contained within the fetcher object itself. Here's a code snippet
from the docs demonstrating the different parts of a fetcher:

```tsx
import { useFetcher } from '@remix-run/react'

function SomeComponent() {
	const fetcher = useFetcher()

	// trigger the fetch with these
	const ui = <fetcher.Form {...formOptions} />
	// for imperative fetches:
	useEffect(() => {
		// to submit data
		fetcher.submit(data, options)
		// or to get data:
		fetcher.load(href)
	}, [fetcher])

	// build UI with these
	fetcher.state
	fetcher.formMethod
	fetcher.formAction
	fetcher.formData
	fetcher.formEncType
	fetcher.data
}
```

👨‍💼 Thanks Olivia. Because a theme switcher is not a navigation type of mutation,
we'll want to use `useFetcher` to make the request. Because the mutation is made
as a result of the user action, we can use `fetcher.Form` to make the request.

We'll not actually get the theme to switch in this step, but you should be able
to add a `console.log` in the action and have the request data there when you're
done.
