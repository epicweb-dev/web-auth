# Optimistic Theme

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/cookies/implementing-optimistic-ui-for-theme-switching" />

👨‍💼 Users on a slow network are complaining the theme won't actually change until
the network request to change it finishes. Go ahead and throttle your network
speed using the browser developer tools and you'll observe that. This is a
pretty poor user experience.

So let's improve this by apply optimistic UI to the theme selection. What we'll
do is make a `useTheme` hook that returns the value of the root loader's
`data.theme`, but then we'll also search for the `fetcher` that's responsible
for changing the cookie and if it's in the process of updating the theme value,
we'll return that from our `useTheme` instead of the `data.theme` value.

That way the theme in the UI will always be what the user selected most recently
even if the network request isn't finished yet.

Here's a quick example of finding the right fetcher using `useFetchers`:

```tsx
import { useFetcher, useFetchers } from '@remix-run/react'

function MyComponent() {
	const fetcher = useFetcher()

	return (
		<fetcher.Form>
			<input type="hidden" name="candy" value="twix" />
			<button name="intent" value="dispense-candy">
				Dispense
			</button>
		</fetcher.Form>
	)
}

function useCurrentlySubmittingCandy() {
	const fetchers = useFetchers()
	const candyFetcher = fetchers.find(
		fetcher => fetcher.formData?.get('intent') === 'dispense-candy',
	)
	return candyFetcher?.formData.get('candy')
}
```

It should be noted that the all fetchers on the page which have been submitted
at least once, will be returned by the `useFetchers` hook, whether they're
currently submitting or not. However, only those which are currently submitting
will have a `formData` property. And in this example since we only care about
the candy fetcher while it's submitting, we can use the `formData` property to
get the value of the candy that's being dispensed.
