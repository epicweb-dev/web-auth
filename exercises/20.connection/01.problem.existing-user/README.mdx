# Existing User

👨‍💼 Here's the scenario:

1. A user with email address signs up for an account using email and password.
1. That user has a GitHub account with the same email address.
1. Later, that user clicks "Login with GitHub"
1. We resolve their GitHub profile and find their GitHub email address matches
   the email address they used to sign up for an account.
1. We create a connection for them, and log them in.

That's what you're going to do in this exercise. I also want you to give them
a toast notification explaining what happened and send them to the
`/settings/profile/connections` page so they can see their new connection.

Don't forget you can use the `makeSession` utility Kellie 🧝‍♂️ put together for
us to make this easier!

🧝‍♂️ In this exercise, I've temporarily removed Kody's connection to a GitHub
account from <InlineFile file="prisma/seed.ts" /> so we can test out the flow of
an existing user who does not have a connection using login in with GitHub with
a matching account. If it's not working, or you need to test it out again, you
can run `npx prisma db seed` to reset the database.
