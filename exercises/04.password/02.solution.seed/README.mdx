# Data Model for Passwords

👨‍💼 Great! We're now ready to add this to our signup flow so when a user signs up
for an account they can also create a password.

🧝‍♂️ To get things ready for you, I'm going to implement the session logic for the
sign up so you can focus on the password bit. If you'd like to do it yourself
though, go ahead. It'll be pretty similar to the login flow.

As always, you can <DiffLink>review my work</DiffLink>
