# Data Model for Passwords

ü¶â Modeling Passwords requires special consideration. A password hash is a
single field, so it may make sense to simply include the `hash` on the `User`
model. However, recall that the default behavior for a select statement
(particularly in Prisma where you can leave off the `select`) is to return all
fields. So if we were to include the `hash` on the `User` model, then every time
we queried for a `User` we would get the `hash` back. An unfortunate oversight
on the part of a developer could lead to leaking all password hashes in the UI.
üò±

Instead, we will create a separate `Password` model that has a one-to-one
relationship to the `User` model. This way, the default of query the `User`
will not include the password hash (at worst, it will include the `id` of the
password which is not a concern).

Unfortunately, it's not possible to enforce a required value on both sides of a
one-to-one relationship. So we can't enforce that a password is required on the
`User` model at the database level. However, it's worth the tradeoff to avoid
the risk of leaking passwords. (see this
[issue](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/web-auth/issues/7#issue-1912551875) for
more information).

üê® Add the model in <InlineFile file="prisma/schema.prisma" />, then run:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma migrate dev --name password
```

That should get you set up with a migration for adding the password to the
database and ready for the next step.
