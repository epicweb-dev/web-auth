# Redirect from Login

👨‍💼 Imagine this scenario... You're a user and you receive an email from us
inviting you to add your name in your profile settings. You click the link and
are redirected to the login page. After logging in, you're redirected to the
home page. You have now forgotten why you came here in the first place and move
on with your day.

Boo! That's not a great user experience. Let's fix it.

There are a few ways to do this, but the most common is to use a query string
parameter. We'll add `redirectTo` support to both our login and signup forms.
That way, our `requireUserId` utility can take the `request.url` and create an
appropriate `redirectTo` query param automatically when it redirects to the
login page. Here's how it should work:

```tsx filename=app/routes/kittens/new.tsx
// Defaults to the current request.url.
// This would redirect to `/login?redirectTo=%2Fkittens%2Fnew`
await requireUserId(request)

// Can override the default with a custom redirectTo.
// This would redirect to `/login?redirectTo=%2Fkittens`
await requireUserId(request, { redirectTo: '/kittens' })

// Can disable the default with null.
// This would redirect to `/login`
await requireUserId(request, { redirectTo: null })
```

🧝‍♂️ Supporting `redirectTo` in `/login` and `/signup` is exactly the same, so
I'll do the `/signup` route for you. Deal? Cool 👍

We'll also want to update the link from our `/login` page to the `/signup` page
so if the user needs to create an account instead, the `redirectTo` will carry
over to that page too.

🦉 Don't miss this point! `redirectTo` query params can be abused by attackers.
A baddy could use a `redirectTo` query param to redirect a user to a malicious
site after logging in. So you should always validate the `redirectTo` query
param to make sure it's a valid URL on your site. It's sufficient to just make
sure the URL doesn't start with `http` or `https` and that it starts with `/`.

Luckily for us, there's a utility in
[`remix-utils`: `safeRedirect`](https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-utils#safe-redirects).
Here's the example from their docs:

```tsx
export async function loader({ request }: LoaderArgs) {
	let { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
	let redirectTo = searchParams.get('redirectTo')
	return redirect(safeRedirect(redirectTo, '/home'))
}
```

In our case, we don't need the `/home` fallback (it defaults to `/`).

🧝‍♂️ There's not too much to the forms for this one, so I'm going to make you do
this one on your own.

I do recommend you add the `redirectTo` support to the `requireUserId` util
in <InlineFile file="app/utils/auth.server.ts" /> first.
