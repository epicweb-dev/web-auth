# Require Authenticated

👨‍💼 This will be really similar to the `requireAnonymous` utility you just made,
except this one will do the opposite. It will be `requireUserId` and it should
return the `userId` because we actually normally need that value.

Then you'll need to apply it to the `loader` and `action` of all the routes that
require a user to be logged in.

In the case of `action`s, you'll likely need to get the `userId` and use that to
perform the updates to the database. You'll find a few places we were using
`params.username` to create/update/delete things. You'll need to change those to
use the `userId` instead.

🐨 So start in <InlineFile file="app/utils/auth.server.ts" /> and then move on
to the other files in the files dropdown below.
