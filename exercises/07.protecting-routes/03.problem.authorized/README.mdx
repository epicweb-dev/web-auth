# Require Authorized

👨‍💼 We've got a number of pages that users have no business being on. Like the
edit page of someone else's note, for example, if you're not logged in, you
should not be able to go to <LinkToApp to="/users/kody/notes/d27a197e/edit" />
or <LinkToApp to="/users/kody/notes/new" />.

And you certainly shouldn't be able to _do_ anything on those pages as well. So
in this exercise, you're going to make a new `requireUser` utility which you can
then apply to those routes' `loaders` and `actions`.

The emoji will be there to guide you! Have fun!
