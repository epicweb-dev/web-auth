# Pass Redirect URL

👨‍💼 We need to get the `redirectTo` URL forwarded on to the `/auth/github` route.
So first, you'll need to update <InlineFile file="app/utils/connections.tsx" />
to have the `ProviderConnectionForm` component accept a `redirectTo` prop and
render a hidden input with the `redirectTo` value. Then update its usage
in <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/login.tsx" />
and <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/signup.tsx" /> to pass the `redirectTo`
prop.

This one should be pretty quick. You can verify things are working by being
logged out, and going to <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile" />. There should be
an `input` with that `redirectTo` value.
