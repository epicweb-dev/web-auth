# Set Cookie

👨‍💼 Now that we're sending the `redirectTo` value to our `/auth/github` action,
we can set that in the cookie. However, this is going to be a bit more tricky
because we're not the ones creating the redirect `Response` object. To
complicate things further, the response is actually `throw`n rather than simply
`returned`, so we need to wrap stuff in `try/catch` and then test if the thrown
thing is an `Response`. If it is, then we can append our `redirectCookie` to its
headers.

We also want to have the `redirectTo` default to whoever sent us here as well as
a convenience, so you'll be using a utility called `getReferrerRoute`.

When you're done, you should be able to observe the `set-cookie` header after
performing these actions:

1. Be logged out
1. Go to <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile" />
1. You'll be redirected to `/login`
1. Click "Login with GitHub"

The `set-cookie` header should appear on the redirect response.

Good luck!
