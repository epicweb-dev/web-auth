# Delete Note

👨‍💼 Great! Now admins can delete other user's notes. This will be useful for
moderation purposes.

🦉 Adding a permissions model to an application requires quite a bit of extra
work in the app code. It's possible you could build in this permissions model
into the prisma client via
[prisma client extensions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions)
which would drastically simplify the amount of work necessary. For example, you
could do something like this:

```tsx
export function action(request) {
	const client = prisma.$extend(getUserPrisma(request))
}
```

And then the client would honor the permissions. If you're interested in
building this out, please give it a shot and let us know how it goes!

That said, there are some handy utilities we can make to make this easier. We'll
get to those in the next step.

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to make a couple utilities for working with permissions and we'll
have you use those in the next step. I'm also going to add an `/admin` route
which will just be a placeholder we'll build out later.
