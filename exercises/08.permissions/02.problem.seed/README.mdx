# Roles Seed

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/permissions/managing-roles-and-permissions" />

👨‍💼 Perhaps in the future we'll want pretty fine-grained roles and permissions,
but for now we really only have two roles:

1. `admin` - which can do anything to everything
2. `user` - which can do anything to their own data

We want to apply these roles and permissions to all new users who are created.
That means that our database needs to have these values before we can create
any users. Our <InlineFile file="prisma/seed.ts" /> is intended to seed the
local development database, but we're going to need this seeding in production
as well.

So, what we need is to manually update our the `migration.sql` file we just made
for our permissions to create the roles and permissions. That way when we deploy
our updates to production, the production database will automatically get these
roles and permissions.

The tricky bit is knowing how to write the SQL to create the roles and
permissions. If you're a SQL wiz, feel free to write it by hand, but for the
rest of us, here's a strategy:

1. Create a temporary script file that generates a temporary database and seeds
   it with the data we want:

<details>

<summary>Feel free to use my script</summary>

```tsx filename=tmp.ignored.js
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { execaCommand } from 'execa'

const datasourceUrl = 'file:./tmp.ignored.db'
console.time('🗄️ Created database...')
await execaCommand('npx prisma migrate deploy', {
	stdio: 'inherit',
	env: { DATABASE_URL: datasourceUrl },
})
console.timeEnd('🗄️ Created database...')

const prisma = new PrismaClient({ datasourceUrl })

console.time('🔑 Created permissions...')
const entities = ['user', 'note']
const actions = ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete']
const accesses = ['own', 'any']
for (const entity of entities) {
	for (const action of actions) {
		for (const access of accesses) {
			await prisma.permission.create({ data: { entity, action, access } })
		}
	}
}
console.timeEnd('🔑 Created permissions...')

console.time('👑 Created roles...')
await prisma.role.create({
	data: {
		name: 'admin',
		permissions: {
			connect: await prisma.permission.findMany({
				select: { id: true },
				where: { access: 'any' },
			}),
		},
	},
})
await prisma.role.create({
	data: {
		name: 'user',
		permissions: {
			connect: await prisma.permission.findMany({
				select: { id: true },
				where: { access: 'own' },
			}),
		},
	},
})
console.timeEnd('👑 Created roles...')

console.log('✅ all done')
```

</details>

2. Run the script with `node tmp.ignored.js`
3. Create a "dump" of all the data in the temporary database using
   [`sqlite3`](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) (install instructions in
   [exercise 9 of the Data workshop](https://data.epicweb.dev/09)):

   ```sh
   sqlite3 tmp.ignored.db .dump > tmp.ignored.sql
   ```

4. Copy the `INSERT` statements (only the `INSERT` statements) from the
   `tmp.ignored.sql` file into the permissions `migration.sql` file in
   `prisma/migrations`.

Once you've done that, you can update <InlineFile file="prisma/seed.ts" />
to assign the "user" roles to the generated users and the "admin" and "user"
roles to the `Kody` user.

Once you've finished updating the seed script, you can reset the database and
run the seed with:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma migrate reset --force
```

But before we wrap this up, you'll want to make sure we create all new users
with the `user` role, otherwise new users won't have the right permissions!

We do that in <InlineFile file="app/utils/auth.server.ts" />, so get that
updated too please.
