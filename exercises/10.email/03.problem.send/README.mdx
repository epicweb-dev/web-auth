# Send Email

👨‍💼 Alright, so we've got a new product requirement. Now on the `/signup` page,
all we display is a form with an email input. When the user submits the form,
we want to send them an email with a link to finish onboarding.

For this step though, we just want you to send a test email to make sure we've
got everything working. When you're done you should be able to submit the form
and get the log of the email that you send in the terminal.
