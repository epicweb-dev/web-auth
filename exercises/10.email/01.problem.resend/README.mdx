# Resend

👨‍💼 Let's get set up with Resend. Now if you'd like to sign up for an account be
my guest, but the company's not going to pay for all your development emails. So
instead I recommend you just make a fake `RESEND_API_KEY` because in the next
step we're going to mock the API for local development anyway.

🐨 First create the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable
in <InlineFile file=".env" /> and add it to the validated variables in
the <InlineFile file="app/utils/env.server.ts" /> file.

Once you've got that done, I want you to write up the email sending utility
in <InlineFile file="app/utils/email.server.ts" /> which Kellie 🧝‍♂️ already started a
bit.

NOTE: we'll get to the `@react-email/components` stuff later. Right now you'll
just use the basic `text` and `html` options.

If you'd like to test it out, be my guest (just stick a `sendEmail` call in the
loader of the `/signup` route and log the response or something), but unless you
set up a real account, it won't do anything. We'll get to that next.
