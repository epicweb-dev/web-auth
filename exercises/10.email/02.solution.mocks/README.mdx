# Mocks

👨‍💼 Great! We'll be using this mock server for more of our integrations in the
future. It's a great way to develop epic apps 🚀

Just so you know, we're coming up with a change in product requirements. We want
users to verify their email before they sign up for an account. So Kellie 🧝‍♂️
will be reworking things to split up the email field from the rest of the
onboarding fields. When she's done, we'll have a new `/onboarding` route that
collects all the user info and the `/signup` route will only accept an email
address.

🧝‍♂️ Yep, it's pretty basic refactoring work you've seen before, but of course you
can <DiffLink app1={0} app2={1} preview>checkout my changes</DiffLink> if you'd
like. (Or if you have time, you can try and do this refactor yourself).
