# Mocks

Mocking API calls is important not only for testing (which is where it's more
often associated), but also during development. It makes you faster at releasing
features because it allows you to work in parallel with the team responsible
for the API you're calling and it also helps you avoid issues with keeping
private keys locally and if the service ever falls over you can continue to
develop.

The de-facto standard for mocking API calls in Node.js applications is
[MSW](https://mswjs.io/). MSW is a library that can run in both the browser and
on the server and allows you to intercept any request made by your application.
It gives you the opportunity to either let the request go through to the
original endpoint or to return a mocked response.

Here's a simple example of setting up a mock for an API call (modified slightly)
from their docs:

```ts
import { rest } from 'msw'
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'

const server = setupServer(
	// Describe the requests to mock.
	rest.get('https://example.com/book/:bookId', (req, res, ctx) => {
		return res(
			ctx.json({
				title: 'Lord of the Rings',
				author: 'J. R. R. Tolkien',
			}),
		)
	}),
)

server.listen()
```

With this set up and running within your server, any GET request made to a URL
matching that pattern will be intercepted by MSW and return a mocked response
instead.

🧝‍♂️ Like I said, I already got some things set up for you, so you'll just need to
add a mock for the resend email API call. You'll also need to be the one who
gets the mocks file imported and sets the right environment variable during
development to enable that.

👨‍💼 I recommend you start in the <InlineFile file="tests/mocks/index.ts" /> file
to add the mock, and then set the `MOCKS` environment variable
in <InlineFile file="server/dev-server.js" />, and then finally import the mocks
file in <InlineFile file="index.js" />.

Once you're done, you should be able to do another test by calling `sendEmail`
from within <InlineFile file="app/utils/email.server.ts" /> and you'll see the
email that was sent is logged to the console!
