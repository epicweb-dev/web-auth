# Connection Model

👨‍💼 Great job! Now we've got a great foundation for our third party
authentication and connected accounts. You may have noticed, we don't store an
access token or refresh token in the database. That's because we don't actively
perform actions on the user's behalf in the background on GitHub so we don't
need to. We're just using GitHub as an authentication mechanism. If we did want
to perform actions or retrieve data for our users in the background, that would
require a bit more work and we'd need to store more data in our database.

As it is, we're all set!

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to do some more work, <DiffLink>check it out here</DiffLink>, but
I'll describe it for you at a high level:

- I'm restructuring things to make them more generic, so `auth.github.ts` and
  `auth.github.callback.ts` will now become `auth.$provider.ts` and
  `auth.$provider.callback.ts`
- I'm making an `/onboarding/$provider` route which you'll be making changes to
  soon. It's similar to our regular onboarding route, but without the password
  fields and most of the fields should be auto-filled (even the user's image!)
  when you're done.
- I'm adding a `/settings/profile/connections` page to list the user's
  connections. This also requires interacting with the GitHub API to lookup a
  GitHub user's username from their id, so I'm adding a `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  environment variable so we can do that.
- I'm moving some of our stuff from `app/utils/auth.server.ts` to more specific
  files like `app/utils/providers/github.server.ts`
- I'm also adding a "Signup with GitHub" button on the `/signup` route.

That's the main stuff. As usual, if you'd prefer to do this stuff, I'm not
stopping you. We'll be ready for you when you're ready to move on!
