# Mock GitHub OAuth

👨‍💼 Great job! Now we can go through the auth process without relying on the
third party.

🦉 Note, you may be wondering if we're only doing this to make it easier for you
to go through the workshop. That's a nice side-effect, but I want to be clear
that this really is how I recommend doing this in real applications. Your tests
and development environment should be as free from third-party dependencies as
possible to improve your development velocity.

👨‍💼 Thanks Olivia 🦉! Great, now let's make things real by adding a new model to
the database.
