# Unverified Session

👨‍💼 Right now when a user logs in, we create a session for them and place the ID
for that in the `sessionStorage` cookie. But for users who have enabled 2FA,
we're going to place that in the `verifySessionStorage` cookie instead and send
them over to `/verify` to verify their session.

That's what you'll be doing in this exercise! Just make sure you don't break the
experience for existing users please! So only do this if the user has a 2FA
verification on their account.
