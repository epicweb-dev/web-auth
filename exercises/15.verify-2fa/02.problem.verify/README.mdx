# Handle Verification

👨‍💼 This is going to feel pretty similar to the other verifications we've done so
far (hooray for nice abstractions). We're going to need to adjust things
slightly though because with other verifications we wanted to delete them after
they've been used, but in the case of 2FA, we want to keep the verification
around.

You're also going to implement the `handleVerification` for the login process
which will upgrade the user's `sessionId` from the `verifySessionStorage` cookie
to the regular `sessionStorage` cookie. You'll need to commit both of these
cookies, and make sure you set the `expires` properly on the `sessionStorage` as
well.

Good luck!
