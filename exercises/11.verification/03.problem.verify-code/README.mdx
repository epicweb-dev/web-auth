# Verify Code

👨‍💼 We're going to have you add a query param to the `/verify` route in this step
so you get an idea of how things flow through the `/verify` route. We need to
have a `type` query param which will signify the type of verification taking
place. And we want to make this typesafe as well (no pun intended). So we're
going to be using [`zod`](https://zod.dev) to do runtime validation of all the
valid types. For now, only `'onboarding'` is valid, but eventually we'll have
others.

So you'll want to make sure the `type` is included in the form and that its
value is derived from the `searchParams`.

Once the code is submitted, we'll want to verify it by finding the verification
in the database by it's `target` and `type` and only if it's not expired. If we
can't find one then we'll show an "Invalid code" error. If we can, then we'll
use [`@epic-web/totp`](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/totp)'s `verifyTOTP`
function to verify the code. If it's invalid then we'll show an "Invalid code"
error.

If it's valid, then we'll delete the verification from the database and do what
we were doing before to get people into onboarding. Only this time we now know
for certain that they have access to the email address they submitted.

That should be enough to get you going! Enjoy.
