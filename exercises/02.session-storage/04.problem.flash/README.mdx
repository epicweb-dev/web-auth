# Session Flash Messages

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/session-storage/implementing-flash-messages-for-temporary-notifications" />

👨‍💼 Turns out the concept of creating a temporary session value is pretty common.
So common in fact that there's a pattern and an API for handling this.

The pattern is called the "flash" pattern. It's a temporary session value that
is meant to be displayed to the user and then removed.

Right now what we're doing can be represented like this:

```
set -> commit -> get -> unset -> commit
```

With the flash pattern it looks like this:

```
flash -> commit -> get -> commit
```

When you use `session.flash` it automatically `unset`s the value after the next
`get` of that value.

So what we can do is change our `set` call to `flash` and then we don't have to
worry about calling `unset` anymore. So go ahead and make those updates and
we'll be in a good spot.

It's important to note that we do still need to commit the session because it
is being changed. This isn't a web standard API or anything. This is just a
common pattern that people use.
