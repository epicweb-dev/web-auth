# Session Storage

Storing user preferences in cookies is simple enough. If you check the developer
tools for those, you'll often find the value as-is and can modify it using the
developer tools (and sometimes even with JavaScript). For user preferences
that's fine, but when it comes to authentication, we need to be more careful.
Specifically, we need two things:

1. We need to make it so client-side JavaScript can't access (or steal) the
   cookie value.
2. We need to make it so the cookie value can't be modified by the user.

For the first point, we can configure the cookie to make it inaccessible to
client-side JavaScript. For the second point, we can't prevent user's from
changing their cookies, but we can make it so we don't recognize the cookie if
they do. We can use a cryptographic hash function to sign the cookie value. This
way, if the user modifies the cookie value, the signature will no longer match
and we'll know the cookie has been tampered with.

Let's talk more about what you can do to configure cookies. Each cookie has a
name, value, and a set of attributes. The attributes are optional and can be
used to configure the cookie's behavior. The most common attributes are:

- `path`: The path on the server for which the cookie is valid. Defaults to the
  current path. This means if the path is set to `/my-page`, the cookie will
  only be sent to the server when the user is on the `/my-page` path.
- `domain`: The domain for which the cookie is valid. Defaults to the current
  domain. This means if the domain is set to `example.com`, the cookie will be
  sent to the server for all subdomains of `example.com`.
- `expires`: The date and time when the cookie expires. If not set, the cookie
  will expire when the browser is closed.
- `max-age`: The number of seconds until the cookie expires. If not set, the
  cookie will expire when the browser is closed.
- `secure`: If set, the cookie will only be sent to the server over HTTPS.
- `httpOnly`: If set, the cookie will not be accessible to JavaScript. This is
  useful for preventing cross-site scripting attacks.
- `sameSite`: If set, the cookie will only be sent to the server if the request
  originated from the same site. This is useful for preventing cross-site
  request forgery attacks.

Several of these are great to enable for security purposes. However, there is
nothing built-into the specification to prevent cookie tampering.

This is why we using the [cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie) package
which provides a `sign` function that will sign the cookie value using a
cryptographic hash function. It also provides a `verify` function that will
verify the signature. This way, if the user modifies the cookie value, the
signature will no longer match and we'll know the cookie has been tampered with.

## In Remix

Remix has built-in support for cookie configuration including securely signing
and verifying cookies. For a low-level API, you can use
[the `createCookie` utility](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/utils/cookies#createcookie)
which includes several handy methods for working with cookies. For a
higher-level session storage API, you can use one of
[Remix's session storage utilities](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/utils/sessions).

Each uses cookies to track the user's session, but they offer different ways to
store "session" data. There are built-in utilities for storing the data in the
cookie itself, in memory (not recommended for production), on the file system,
or in a database. You can also create your own implementation if you want to
store the data somewhere else.

In practice, it's generally best to avoid storing too much data in the cookie
itself as it will be sent to the server with every request. This can slow down
the user's experience and can also cause problems if the cookie is too large.

In my experience, most of the time the only persistent data stored in a session
cookie is an ID that can be used to look up the rest of the data in a database.
Sometimes temporary data is also stored in the cookie using a pattern called
a ["Cookie Flash"](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/utils/sessions#sessionflashkey-value).
