# Cookie Session Storage

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/session-storage/toast-messages-with-cookies" />

üë®‚Äçüíº We're not talking about `window.sessionStorage` here. We're talking about
storing information about the current session. For this feature, we want to be
able to show the user a toast notification when they delete a note. And we'll
want our solution to be generic enough to use for other notifications in the
future.

We could definitely use one of many React libraries to accomplish this, but
we're going to go OG with the web and use cookies. The idea is in our `action`
for the deletion, we'll set a cookie that has the message we want to show. And
then the `root` loader will read that cookie and send the data along to the
UI where we'll display the toast notification.

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I've already implemented the UI bit for the toast notifications so you can
focus on the session storage bit. Feel free
to <DiffLink app1={-1} app2={0} preview>check out my work</DiffLink> if you'd
like to see what that involved.

üë®‚Äçüíº Based on our requirements, we'll use Remix's
[`createCookieSessionStorage` API](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/utils/sessions#createcookiesessionstorage)
to create a session storage object that we can use to store and retrieve the
`toast` information.

üê® Please <InlineFile file="app/utils/toast.server.ts">Create `app/utils/toast.server.ts`</InlineFile>
to initialize this session storage object.

üê® Configure the cookie option with the following properties:

- `name`: `'en_toast'` - this is the name of the cookie that will be created and
  should be unique relative to other cookies on your domain ("en" is short for
  "Epic Notes").
- `sameSite`: `'lax'` - The cookie is sent with "safe" HTTP methods (like
  `GET`), and only when the request originates from the same site or when the
  user navigates to the URL from an external site, such as by following a link.
  This is a balance between security and usability, preventing the cookie from
  being sent with cross-site POST requests (which are often used in
  [cross-site request forgery attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)),
  but still allowing the user to access content via regular navigation.
- `path`: `'/'` - The cookie is sent for all requests on the domain.
- `httpOnly`: `true` - The cookie is not accessible via JavaScript. This is
  important for security because it prevents cross-site scripting attacks from
  accessing the cookie.
- `secrets`: `process.env.SESSION_SECRET.split(',')` - This is an array of
  secrets that will be used to sign the cookie. This is important for security
  because it prevents the cookie from being tampered with. It's an array so you
  can rotate their values over time. We are using an environment variable for
  the secret. So you'll need to add that to the <InlineFile file=".env" /> file.
  Once you have that set, you can
  update <InlineFile file="app/utils/env.server.ts" /> so you have type-safe
  access to that environment variable.
- `secure`: `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` - The cookie is only sent
  over HTTPS. This is important for security because it prevents the cookie from
  being sent over an insecure connection. We only want to do this in production
  because while some browsers are fine ignoring this on `localhost`, Safari does
  not.

With that, you can add this to export all the bits of the sessionStorage so we
can use them throughout the app:

```ts filename=app/utils/toast.server.ts start=3
export const toastSessionStorage = createCookieSessionStorage({
	// ...
})
```

There's no straightforward way to test that you've got this done correctly until the
next step, so you <Link to="?preview=diff">may check the diff</Link> to
make sure you got it right before moving on.
