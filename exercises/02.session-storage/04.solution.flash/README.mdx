# Session Flash Messages

👨‍💼 Great work. Now we've got a pretty good pattern for handling toast
notifications.

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to refactor the code a bit to make utilities out of this we can
use in other areas of the app in the future. In addition, I'm going to just
destroy the toast cookie altogether after we've read it's value to save on some
bytes per request. If you're interested,

The APIs you'll be able to use in the future are:

```tsx
throw await redirectWithToast(
	'/somewhere',
	{
		title: 'Toast Title',
		description: 'This is a toast description',
		type: 'success',
	},
	{
		status: 201,
		// other response init stuff you wanna do
	},
)

// or, a lower-level API
const headers = createToastHeaders({
	title: 'Toast Title',
	description: 'This is a toast description',
})
return json({ status: 'success' }, { headers })
```
