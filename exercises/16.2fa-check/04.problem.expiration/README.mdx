# Cookie Expiration Override

👨‍💼 Unfortunately, in the process of setting the `verifiedTimeKey` and committing
the session, we override the `expires` value for our session. This means that if
a user selected "Remember Me" in the login form, we forget that when we
re-verify them. Super bummer.

Unfortunately, the browser is the only one that knows the `expires` time on our
cookie (it only sends the server the cookie value) so we can't just read it and
set the expires time based on the existing value.

Instead, we're going to have to store the `expires` time in the session itself.

But this would be super annoying to have to remember to do everywhere we commit
the session... So... We're going to get a little creative in the name of
usability.

The short version is we're going to override the `commitSession` API with a new
implementation that sets the `expires` value on the session cookie based on the
`expires` option it's called with.

You'll also want to handle `maxAge` as this is another way to manage the
expiration time.

To do this, we'll be using
[`Object.defineProperty`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty)
on the `sessionStorage` object. Here's a simple example of how this API works
using `console.log` as the example:

```js
const originalConsoleLog = console.log

Object.defineProperty(console, 'log', {
	value: (...args) => {
		originalConsoleLog('👋', ...args)
	},
})
```

With that, every time someone calls `console.log`, we'll log a little 👋 emoji
ahead of the arguments they passed in.

Hopefully that gives you an idea of how to accomplish something similar for our
`sessionStorage` so we can handle this expiration issue automatically without
requiring anyone to think about it!
