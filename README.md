  <strong>
    Take ownership of your application's authentication and authorization
  </strong>
  <p>
    In this workshop, we'll learn how to implement authentication and

## Prerequisites

- Some
  [experience with JavaScript](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react)
- Some [experience with React](https://kcd.im/beginner-react)
- Some [experience with Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn)
- [Full Stack Foundations workshop](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/full-stack-foundations)
  (or similar experience)
- [Web Forms workshop](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/web-forms) (or similar
  experience)
- [Data Modeling workshop](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/data-modeling) (or
  similar experience)

## Pre-workshop Resources

Here are some resources you can read before taking the workshop to get you up to
speed on some of the tools and concepts we'll be covering:

- [HTTP Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)
- [Remix cookies](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/utils/cookies)
- [Remix sessions](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/utils/sessions)
- [`bcryptjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
- [What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?](https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-role-based-access-control-rbac)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v18 or greater
- [npm][npm] v8 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

This is a pretty large project (it's actually many apps in one) so it can take
several minutes to get everything set up the first time. Please have a strong
network connection before running the setup and grab a snack.

> **Warning**
>
> This repo is _very_ large. Make sure you have a good internet connection
> before you start the setup process. The instructions below use `--depth` to
> limit the amount you download, but if you have a slow connection, or you pay
> for bandwidth, you may want to find a place with a better connection.

Follow these steps to get this set up:

```sh nonumber
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/epicweb-dev/web-auth.git
cd web-auth
npm run setup
```

If you experience errors here, please open [an issue][issue] with as many
details as you can offer.

## Exercises

You'll find all the exercises in the `exercises` directory. The structure of the
workshop apps is described below, but most of the time you should be able to
simply run the app and navigate around the different exercises using the
application (there are even buttons to open the right exercise file right in
your editor).

The purpose of the exercise is **not** for you to work through all the material.
It's intended to get your brain thinking about the right questions to ask me as
_I_ walk through the material.

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

Now open your browser to the address that's logged out for you and you're good
to get started!

## Running the tests

The test script in the `package.json` runs the tests on the solutions (these
should all pass). To run the tests against your own work, you simply open the
problem page and click the "Test" tab.

## Launching your editor

The application has several buttons which will launch your editor to the right
file. There are a lot of files in this workshop so you'll be using this feature
a lot to get to the right place at the right time.

This should just work™️, but if it doesn't it could be that our editor guessing
isn't working for you. If that's the case, create a `.env` file in the root of
this project and add an environment variable called `KCDSHOP_EDITOR` with the
value being set to the path to your editor's executable. For example, if you're
using VS Code on Windows, you'd add this to your `.env` file:

```
KCDSHOP_EDITOR="C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\bin\code.cmd"
```

Make certain that if the path includes spaces that you wrap the path in quotes
as above.

## Exercises

- `exercises/*.*/README.md`: Exercise background information
- `exercises/*.*/*.problem.*/README.*.md`: Problem Instructions
- `exercises/*.*/*.problem.*/*.tsx`: Exercise with Emoji helpers 👈 You spend
  most of your time here.
- `exercises/*.*/*.solution.*/*.tsx`: Solved version

The purpose of the exercise is **not** for you to work through all the material.
It's intended to get your brain thinking about the right questions to ask me as
_I_ walk through the material.
